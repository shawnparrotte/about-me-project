      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>What can I say about myself. <strong>Do I even know what I'm all about?</strong>
      And at what level do I try to even describe the person that is me.
      Right now I'm on a mission of sorts. To see how much an average dude
      can learn in a year. How much of an affect he can have on the world,
      if he desired to add some signal to the noise of what's around us.
      <em>I feel like some kind of idealist</em>. Can you say that I'm an idealist that
      works in the fabric of the real? Actually coming in contact with the
      reality of the world we live in and making an attempt to gain a broad
      perspective on what is going on and learning how to steer things a bit. </p>
      <p>It sure is an egoic gesture to "steer" things. <em>As if I know any better.</em>
      But why not attempt to know? To do the work that is necessary to actually
      see things for what they are. God. There I go again. Assuming that I know that
      there is a veil of some kind over things. What is it? <strong>Ideology.</strong> It will always
      be there. Maybe one of my missions will be to gain a deeper understanding of
      the ideologies that I come in contact with and that are the invisible hands
      that steer us? I don't know. but this was a good point to start the work.</p>
